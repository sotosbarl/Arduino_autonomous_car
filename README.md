# Arduino_autonomous_car
Following Nicholas Renotte's Youtube tutorial on Object Detection using TENSORFLOW we use a dataset of hand gestures that show either left or right. Our algorithm detects and classifies the gesture and sends the appropriate signal to the Smartphone that is attached to the RC CAR. In the Smartphone we have download MIT INVENTOR App and we have written a code that connects to Wi-Fi, receives the signal with the right direction, and then sends the command with Serial Communication to the Arduino Board which moves the servo motor and steers the car.
